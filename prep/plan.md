# Plan

## Tool: Kaboom.JS
## Product: Coffee game: player grows and sells coffee in a shop; follows the idea of making things from scratch;  --> beyond mvp add horror to the game; the customers gradually suffer from the coffee they are sold and an infection spreads through the town; all leading back to the player who has no choice but to continue selling to progress the game and survive

## Timeline

#### MVP

- [ ] designing sprite sheets and game graphics (deadline: feb 24)
  - [ ] make working moveable sprites (deadline: feb 24)
  - [ ] practice every day with kaboom: the goals below should be easy if i tinker enough over the break; these are NOT chronological steps essie 
      over the break i want to focus on laying out the design of my game using the design websites i have sourced; by the end of break i also hope to finish demoing the moving sprites themselves and thoroughly learn other concepts like collectable items, counters, levels, music(bmvp), and dialogue(bmvp)

     
- [ ] make collectible items on a map, and a counter that increases when they are collected; when the items are input where they need to be input, the counter should reset to the value and increase a different value (deadline: march 5th)
    
- [ ] make properly working levels (at least 3 levels for the games MVP); when the player reaches the limit set by one level theyll move to the next level etc etc (deadline: march 10th
  - [ ] demo as much as i can over the break with this concept with practice graphic sheets (deadline: feb 24) 

#### Beyond MVP

- [ ] add dialogue and story: after the fundamentals of the game are taken care of, i want the game to have some sort of narrative inbetween levels (deadline: march 20)
  - [ ] learn how to add dialogue with kaboom (start after learning other topics over the break; deadline: march 20)
     
- [ ] start learning how to make a game soundtrack (preferably in garageband); ask around on slack from alumni who have made soundtracks for their projects (start in feb deadline: march 25th) 
  - [ ] implement the soundtrack into the kaboom game; march 30)
        i really want my game to have a soundtrack, i feel it will make it stand out and be more enjoyable; music sets the mood heavily

- [ ] if i have a lot of time left adding boss fights inbetween levels could also be nice (deadline: april 14)
  - [ ]  learn to make sprite health bars and enemies that move in kaboom (deadline: april 14)
  - [ ]  make designs for a boss and code that in with the demo code made previously (deadline april 14)
