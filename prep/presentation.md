# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* ask a question about the audiences usual coffee order, or a coffee theyve tried before
* reel them in with some context about coffee, its significant origins and its relation to me as a person along with why i chose it as a topic
 * this section should be significantly short and touched on later in my conclusion

## Product
* live demo of my game, id prefer for the sound to be on and also show off the soundtrack too.
* talk about how my ideas for this game influenced its creation; my connection with coffee etc 

## Process
* i want to have a common theme of taking a step back during my presentation, as it was something i had to do alot during the project 
*  first go over my early process: i knew i wanted to make a game that was rpg styled centered around coffee, but the tool i initially chose was impact; later kaboom 
 * go over struggles with impact, what made me want to choose it and why i ultimately scrapped it; the only thing i could successfully make was pong
 * go over kaboom, how i learned it and my steps with integrating my learning to my project
    * firstly i learned how to make a moveable sprite
    * talk about the challenges that came here + how i solved it with images 
    * i integrated sprite animations with this movement so whenever a player clicked a different key the sprite would change
    * then i learned how to build levels
       * talk about the challenges that came during here + include images
    * talk about my transition from mvp to bmvp
       * adding music, fixing the walls and adding sprites 

## Conclusion
* talk about what i learned through making this game; it was a solo passion project that i felt really connected to, alongside the fact that coffee is something celebrated with my family and something shared from person to person.
* leave off with a coffee pun? 
    * good things come to those who au lait
    * java nice day
 * leave off with a note about the project + shoutout to the people who inspired me
      

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
