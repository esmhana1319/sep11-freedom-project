# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **X**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Kaboom** in order to help me make **an interactive coffee game**.

## Implications
##### PROS
* educates people about the process of making coffee
* promotes public awareness of coffee plants in agriculture, which not only contribute to societies cafe menus, but shape the very social norms, office cultures, and industries we live by 
##### CONS
* coffee is something that can negatively impact someones health, and wallet. Caffeine overdose isnt good for anyone really, and the glorification of coffee intake can sponsor unhealthy drinking habits
