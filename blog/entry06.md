#### The expo + my elevator pitch

This year i worked on creating my first self programmed game with kaboom, and finally presented my work at the expo with the pleasure of three very supportive judges. 

I knew my elevator pitch had to cover four points: Creativity, Usability, Practicality, and overall Presentation. So naturally i planned to introduce my audience with my topic, showcase the designs i created myself, explain the intended purpose i desired to fulfill with my project, and interact with my audience with follow up questions and frequent clarification. 

Time was running really quickly, and even though i was the twelfth person to present, the anxiety was still reaching nonetheless. As the judges reached the table next to me i had the bright idea that formed my hook. See, the problem wasnt that i didnt know how to outline my project from an audience perspective, but rather that i wasnt sure how to attract my audience in the first place. As the judges walked up to my table for my presentation, i handed them a coffee candy. Not in a bribing gesture, but rather an introductory one. The main problem i wanted to address with my game was a lack of awareness on what coffee is, and where its from. By inguiring my audience on what the contents of the candy were, i was able to sponsor unsureness, and later understanding. 

#### My presentation 

My presentation was for sure more in depth in regards to my process than my elevator pitch which mostly covered my end product. Not only was i presenting to my peers who had a more higher level of experience with the sep11 curriculum, freedom project, and even my tool, but also to people who supported my journey in making the project itself. What was nerve-wrecking though was that i was presenting to a considerably smaller audience, as many were absent that day. I wanted to frequently address my audience, as i was afraid to lose their attention, but also go over some of my errors in depth along with the importance of the project itself. I felt pretty fulfilled afterwards, and one thing i noted for future presentations was to make sure to capture my audiences attention more. I feel as though i couldve done a better job keeping their attention as well as shortening my presentation itself.

The process of Engineering and Design consist of eight steps 

#### 1. Define the problem [x]
   
#### 2.Research the problem [x]

#### 3.Brainstorm possible solutions [x]

#### 4.Plan the most promising solution [x]

#### 5.Create a prototype [x]

#### 6.Test and evaluate the prototype [x] 

#### 7.Improve as needed [x]

#### 8.Communicate the results [x]

   i communicated the results of my process to the judges, and my audience through my presentation with step 8. 

#### Skills

A skill i developed was thinking creatively. I wasnt confident that the elevator pitch i made beforehand was good enough, so i planned a quick idea with what i had on hand and successfully winged it

```
developed skill *-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
 creativity lvl 13
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-
```

Another skill i developed was employing what i noticed in other presentations to my own for improvement. I noticed that a lot of the more entertaining presentations interacted with their audience more, and spoke to them more directly, so i tried to sponsor that in my own

```
