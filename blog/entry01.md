### Freedom Project Idea: "From Scratch" (coffee game)  

Although i was a bit tied on what i wanted to do for my freedom project, i ultimately decided on creating a game rather than the website follow-up from my SEP10 freedom project, as it was what i believed to be more passionate in doing. Now there were many concepts i had for a game mind you, since ive been looking forward to this year for a while. My first inital idea was a story based game detailing the horrors of prison with a slight sci-fi aspect, but i decided it was ultimately too aspirational and would cause quite trouble for me later on in the year. The second idea i came up with was a coffee based dating simulator (inspired by the CYOA project i worked on last year), which i quickly scrapped as i have no experience nor interest in the field. In the end i came to my final idea, a coffee based story game detailing a fanatical history with a horror aspect. This option could be both quick and simple concept that fulfilled both of the ideas i desired to work on, whilst also being simple yet special enough for my project. 

### Freedom Project Tool: Impact

Of the available tools i could learn for my freedom project, there were Kaboom, Phaser, Impact, P5Play and a couple others. With this wide range of tools it was extremely hard to choose one, and dipping my feet into all of them would be a waste of valuable time. After scrolling through the document pages for all of them, i immediately scratched kaboom, phaser and p5play off the list. I had heard about phaser being not very beginner friendly from peers, whereas kaboom and p5play had too much people working on them, making them ultimately feel less unique to me. Impact seemed the most appealing due to its weltmeister for editing and past projects shown on its website. 

To get started with learning i quickly picked up a couple videos from their website to learn the basic files and their uses along with the tutorial on how to get started on using Impact. My [learning log](../tool/learning-log.md) which linked here, along with a little snippet from it can be seen below. 

the weltmeister is a level editor used by impact js to preview the code and create levels with its designing abilities. Its shortcuts that i need to keep noted are listed below

```
1. hold right or ctrl to drag view

2. left mouse drags selected tile or entity depending on layer

3. space toggles the selection of the previous two

4. backspace or del will delete the selected entity (your sprite)

5. C clones the entity (good for mobs or enemy entities)

6. Z and Y are undo and redo buttons

7. G toggles the grid (this is for the background map of your game)

8. holding shift and left mouse button will enable you to select a part of the map to make your "brush" (by this they mean you can select a couple of tiles and draw them in another area in bulk)
```
### Sources 

- My [learning log](../tool/learning-log.md) is linked here 

- [Impact](https://impactjs.com/) my tool, is linked here

- the videos i went off of can be found [here](https://vimeo.com/17161851), and [here](https://vimeo.com/17163174); ignore mature content warning, i am unsure of why it is flagged for that 

### Engineering Design Process 

The steps of the Engineering and design process consist of eight rules 

#### 1. Define the problem [x]
   
#### 2.Research the problem [x]

#### 3.Brainstorm possible solutions [ ]

#### 4.Plan the most promising solution [ ]

#### 5.Create a prototype [ ]

#### 6.Test and evaluate the prototype [ ] 

#### 7.Improve as needed [ ]

#### 8.Communicate the results [ ]

   Currently, i am on step 3 and 4. I have brainstormed and planned the idea i want to create tand am doing further research to expand on my knowledge on Impact, the tool i am using. After learning my tool, and testing what i can make with it, i can finally start creating prototypes and weighing out what i should include and get rid of in my concept. 

### Skills

A skill i developed was descision making. When choosing my concept for my freedom project, rather than picking one based on how much i liked the idea, i chose one basecd on what would be most convinent for me, the amount of grey area the concept has, and whether or not it would be easy to play around with and alter.

Another skill i developed was research and learning on my own, impact didnt have a lot of resources to go off of but luckily i found things that worked for me by viewing a couple videos, analyzing other projects, and looking at their website for more information
