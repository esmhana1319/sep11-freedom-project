### Freedom Project Idea: "From Scratch" (coffee game)  

Although i was a bit tied on what i wanted to do for my freedom project, i ultimately decided on creating a game rather than the website follow-up from my SEP10 freedom project, as it was what i believed to be more passionate in doing. Now there were many concepts i had for a game mind you, since ive been looking forward to this year for a while. My first inital idea was a story based game detailing the horrors of prison with a slight sci-fi aspect, but i decided it was ultimately too aspirational and would cause quite trouble for me later on in the year. The second idea i came up with was a coffee based dating simulator (inspired by the CYOA project i worked on last year), which i quickly scrapped as i have no experience nor interest in the field. In the end i came to my final idea, a coffee based story game detailing a fanatical history with a horror aspect. This option could be both quick and simple concept that fulfilled both of the ideas i desired to work on, whilst also being simple yet special enough for my project. 

### Freedom Project Tool: Impact

Of the available tools i could learn for my freedom project, there were Kaboom, Phaser, Impact, P5Play and a couple others. With this wide range of tools it was extremely hard to choose one, and dipping my feet into all of them would be a waste of valuable time. After scrolling through the document pages for all of them, i immediately scratched kaboom, phaser and p5play off the list. I had heard about phaser being not very beginner friendly from peers, whereas kaboom and p5play had too much people working on them, making them ultimately feel less unique to me. Impact seemed the most appealing due to its weltmeister for editing and past projects shown on its website. 

To get started with learning i quickly picked up a couple videos from their website to learn the basic files and their uses along with the tutorial on how to get started on using Impact.
