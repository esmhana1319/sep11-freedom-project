### What ive been up to: Impact and further brainstorming 

Learning my tool, impact, so far has been interesting. ive found that learning impact with their website is fine, but i really wish there were more sources to go off of, incase my code comes out wrong. The first thing i did after installing impact.js was familiarizing myself with their files and general outputs; ie what each one did and what they were meant for, along with starting to learn how to make entities. 

I found that the best way to learn was by referencing actual games created by impact, in specific their pong game; the most simple, to view a frame i needed to work towards from the beginning. 

Heres a snippet from my learning log regarding the pong game and entiities.
