### Kaboom: progress from the previous blog

In the last entry, i attempted making my own moving sprite with set animations to demo how my games character would move. I struggled before with getting things to run properly, though, and id keep recieving the same error "onGround is not a function". After comparing my code with the reference on Kabooms website, i was able to deduce that i was missing a couple lines of code that mightve contributed to the error i was facing. Shortly, after a couple process of eliminations and switcharoos here and there, i found that not defining <code> body() </code> of my sprite was causing everything to break.

Now, after successfully solving my previous issue, my next objective was to set the scene for different levels in an rpg format.
